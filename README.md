This project compare two algoritm to TSP problem, the first algorithm use dynamic programe to solve is an exact algorithm and the second use heuristc to solve, in this case use ant colony algorithm.

1) The Requiremnts 

First step to run you need install some required library with below command.
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

We recomend to use venv to segregade your environment.

2) To Run

2.1) The file matriz.py define an example matrix.
2.2) The file exact.py solve the problem with dynamic program;
2.3) The file ant_colony solve the problem with heuristc;

run: python main.py it will execute both algorithms exact.py and ant_colony.py
